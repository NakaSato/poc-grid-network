## 4. Property-Based Testing Scenarios

### 4.1 Order Matching Properties
```rust
// Property: Total volume conservation
// For any set of orders, total buy volume = total sell volume after matching

// Property: Price improvement
// No trade should execute at a worse price than the best available

// Property: Time priority
// Earlier orders at same price should be filled first

// Property: Order book consistency
// Order book state should always be valid after any operation
```

### 4.2 Database Consistency Properties
```rust
// Property: ACID compliance
// Database operations should maintain consistency

// Property: Referential integrity
// All foreign key relationships should be maintained

// Property: Data persistence
// Committed data should survive system restarts
